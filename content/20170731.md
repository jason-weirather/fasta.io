Summary: A trick with Jinja2 to ensure the client’s browser updates the site's stylesheets each time the site is edited.  I also give Python-Jinja2-Pelican a thumbs up. 🤓👍👍👍

I bet theres a lot of blogs out there that start with musings on making the blog. 🤔 This is a nothing-special pelican jinja2 static site getting hosted on GitHub.  

Jinja2 templates are really nice and since I'm using them for Flask recently, they seem like a major evolution beyond php for reusing code.

Heres one fun thing to share.  A bit of **a hack to get Jinja2 to emit UUID4s on the page**.

### Objective
Ensure browser updates linked stylesheets each time the site is rebuilt, rather than using cached versions.

### Strategy
Use Jinja2 to add a random version identifier to the URL of the stylesheet. I saw this trick of adding a random identifyer to the URL over on stackoverflow[1] and got it work in the Jinja2 framework this blog is using. Each time the site is built, a random string is added as a GET format variable on the URL and thus the browser is encouraged to reload this new entity. A good and a bad thing to this approach is that the version of the CSS is only updated when the site is rebuilt, not every time the client loads the site.  If you need it every time ... better be using flask or javascript to accomplish that.  Fortunetly this is exactly the behavior we need for a static site like this.

### Code 

Where a version string is added to the URL of the style sheet. I wanted to do something like that without this blog since I’ll be editing the style sheet a lot, and I found a way to get UUID4’s into the jinja2.  Its kind of a hack because I could only find a way to make filter functions.  So thats what I setup first.

`pelicanconf.py`
```{python}
from uuid import uuid4
def get_uuid4_string(not_used):
   return str(uuid4())
JINJA_FILTERS = {'uuid4':get_uuid4_string}
```

Now with the filter in place we can put it to work to emit UUID4 strings.

`base.html`
```{jinja2}
{# Hack of a jinja2 filter to add uuid4's to links to skirt browser caching #}
<link href="{{ SITEURL }}/theme/static/css/style.css?version={{ 'whatever'|uuid4 }}" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Result

And if we inspect the html of this page… `index.html` we can see it looks okay!

```{html}
   <head>
   <title>Hello World - A bioinformatics adventure</title>
   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
   <link href="/theme/static/css/style.css?version=7921c390-0b9d-4c6b-81a0-6e18fd59683d" rel="stylesheet" />
   </head>
```
