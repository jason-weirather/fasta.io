Summary: I've set up a blog for posting about this and that the technology world. Here is a first entry where I show how to use Jinja2 to get the clientâ€™s browser to update the site each time the site is regenerated.

I wonder how many blogs start with a note on how they made their blog? ðŸ¤”
It seems like an appropriate enough way to go.  I did have one little bit of development from this process I think is worth sharing. Iâ€™m building this on Pelican which uses Jinja2 templates.  This is convenient because Iâ€™ve also been using Flask recently, which also uses Jinja 2.

### Objective
Ensure browser updates linked stylesheets each time the site is rebuilt, rather than using cached versions.

### Strategy
Add a random version identifier to the URL of the stylesheet. I saw this trick on stackoverflow[1] and got it work in the Jinja2 framework this blog is using. Each time the site is built, a random string is added at the end of the URL and the browser is encouraged to reload this new entity. A good and a bad thing to this approach is that the version of the CSS is only updated when the site is rebuilt, not when the client loads the site.  But thats fine with me, because we will rebuilt it on each update.

### Code 

Where a version string is added to the URL of the style sheet. I wanted to do something like that without this blog since Iâ€™ll be editing the style sheet a lot, and I found a way to get UUID4â€™s into the jinja2.  Its kind of a hack because I could only find a way to make filter functions.  So thats what I setup first.

`pelicanconf.py`
```{python}
from uuid import uuid4
def get_uuid4_string(not_used):
   return str(uuid4())
JINJA_FILTERS = {'uuid4':get_uuid4_string}
```

Now with the filter in place we can put it to work to emit UUID4 strings.

`base.html`
```{jinja2}
{# Hack of a jinja2 filter to add uuid4's to links to skirt browser caching #}
<link href="{{ SITEURL }}/theme/static/css/style.css?version={{ 'whatever'|uuid4 }}" rel="stylesheet" />
```

### Result

And if we inspect the html of this pageâ€¦ `index.html` we can see it looks okay!

```{html}
   <head>
   <title>Hello World - A bioinformatics adventure</title>
   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
   <link href="/theme/static/css/style.css?version=7921c390-0b9d-4c6b-81a0-6e18fd59683d" rel="stylesheet" />
   </head>
```
